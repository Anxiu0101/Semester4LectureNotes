## Q1

Consider the following specification text: “A client company that sells oil burners needs a specific editorial content management system to manage product manuals that are written for customers. Engineers write and submit drafts of product manuals. Reviewers check these manuals for their technical accuracy and the quality of writing (so that customers can understand them). There is a list of reviewers (an audit committee) who can review and evaluate the submitted manuals. The chief editor will distribute the manuals to relevant reviewers (those that have the necessary technical knowledge). The reviewers then submit their reviews/comments and a score to the system. The chief editor will make the decision about accepting the manual to be published online or to reject the manual and return it to the engineer. The chief editor then notifies the engineers about the status of their submission.”
1. Given the above specification text, draw two data flow diagrams (DFD): First a high-level (Level 0) DFD followed by a more detailed level (Level 1) DFD. [20 marks]
2. Represent the following text as an entity relationship (ER) diagram: ‘Staff registers a client at a branch’. [5 marks]
