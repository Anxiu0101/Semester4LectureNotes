#Architectural-Design

- Among all requirements there are a few that have special importance for the architecture, known as Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs): 
	- E.g., the most important functionality of the system, the constraints and the quality attributes such as high performance and high availability, etc.
- Design is a translation, from requirements to solutions, which can be structures composed of code, frameworks, and components.
- Preliminary documentation (sketches) of the structures should be created as part of architectural design.
- If the project under development is non-trivial, then the design should be evaluated to ensure that the decisions made are appropriate to address the ASRs.
- An architectâ€™s responsibility during implementation is to ensure conformance of the code to the design.
