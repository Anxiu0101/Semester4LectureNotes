- Among all requirements there are a few that have special importance for the architecture, known as Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) 在所有的需求中，有一些对架构有特殊的重要性，被称为架构上的重要需求: 
	- E.g., the most important functionality of the system, the constraints and the quality attributes such as high performance and high availability, etc. 例如，系统最重要的功能，约束条件和质量属性，如高性能和高可用性，等等。

- Design is a translation, from requirements to solutions, which can be structures composed of code, frameworks, and components. 设计是一种转换，从需求到解决方案，它可以是由代码、框架和组件组成的结构。

- Preliminary documentation (sketches) of the structures should be created as part of architectural design. 结构的初步文件（草图）应该作为架构设计的一部分被创建。

- If the project under development is non-trivial, then the design should be evaluated to ensure that the decisions made are appropriate to address the ASRs. 如果正在开发的项目是不简单的，那么应该对设计进行评估，以确保所做的决定适合于解决ASRs。

- An architect’s responsibility during implementation is to ensure conformance of the code to the design. 在实施过程中，架构师的责任是确保代码与设计的一致性。
