## Q24

> A software system supporting an online TV and film streaming service is being designed. The investors of the software system envisaged that they would have multi-millions of subscribers. 1) draw a Context Diagram of the system being designed, 2) there are many desired characteristics of the system, such as, security, scalability, availability, accessibility, access speed, and high throughput. From the experience, we already know that implementing too many of those non-functional requirements is not recommended.  As a project manager and architect, how you would balance between these non-functional requirements for the system?
