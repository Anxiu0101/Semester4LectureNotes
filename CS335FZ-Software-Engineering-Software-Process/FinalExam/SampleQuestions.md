## Q1

> If you were given a task to develop a software system to control a medical device for surgery, would the Waterfall model be a good choice for the development of the project? Explain why your decision is appropriate.

## Q2

> In extreme Programming (XP), what are slack tasks? Explain why we need them.


## Q3

> What is refactoring?

Refactoring refers to improving the quality and performance of the software by adjusting the program code, making the design pattern and architecture of the program more reasonable, and improving the scalability and maintainability of the software.


## Q4

> In the Integration and Configuration model, we often have to refine requirements. What are the potential side-effects of refining requirements? Use an example to support your answer.


## Q5

> In the Integration and Configuration model, we often have to refine requirements. What are the potential side-effects of refining requirements? Use an example to support your answer.


## Q6

> Is the Inception phase of the Rational Unified Process the same as the Requirements Definition phase of the Waterfall model? If not, what the differences are?


## Q7

> Is the Inception phase of the Rational Unified Process the same as the Requirements Definition phase of the Waterfall model? If not, what the differences are?


## Q8

> What are the differences between Iterative Process and Agile Process?


## Q9

> In the context of eXtreme Programming (XP), what is a spike? Explain why we need spikes?


## Q10

> Briefly describe the relationship between the concepts Sprint Backlog and Product Backlog in Scrum development.


## Q11

> In Requirements Engineering, interview, ethnography and stories are the three common techniques used for requirement elicitation and analysis, briefly explain the main purpose of each technique (make one point for each technique).


## Q12

>  In the Agile Manifesto, one of the statements says, “working software over comprehensive documentation”. How do you interpret the statement? Is the statement universally applicable to all software development? Explain with examples.


## Q13

> In eXtreme Programming, why we need to provide estimate for Stories?


## Q14

> What is meant by Adaptation in Scrum method? What are the mechanisms used in Scrum to ensure Adaptation?


## Q15

>  The Tesco Stores in Ireland want to upgrade their online food delivery system. Discuss whether a food supplier of the Tesco Stores is a stakeholder of the system to be developed.


## Q16

> A non-functional requirement must be measurable. In practice, a non-functional requirement can be formulated in a Quality Attribute Scenario (QAS). In a QAS, what are meant by the _environment_ and the _artifact_?


## Q17

> What is the main difference between functional requirements and non-functional requirements? Give one example for each type of requirement.


## Q18

> Explain briefly the GRASP principles of Information Expert, Pure Fabrication, Indirection and Protected Variation.


## Q19

> State what is meant by _coupling_ and what is meant by _cohesion_, as used in software engineering? Use examples to support your answer.


## Q20

> How would you maintain high-scalability and high-availability at the same time for a distributed web store?


## Q21

> Non-functional requirements can be categorised into Product Requirements, Organisational Requirements and External Requirements. Given one example of each (don’t use the example shown in the Lecture Notes).


## Q22

> Given a requirement statement, how you would identify whether the requirement is a functional requirement or a non-functional requirement?


## Q23

> Why do we need to prioritise requirements? Who should be involved in prioritising requirements when using Utility Trees? Why are they the most suitable candidates for prioritising requirements, but not others?


## Q24

> A software system supporting an online TV and film streaming service is being designed. The investors of the software system envisaged that they would have multi-millions of subscribers. 1) draw a Context Diagram of the system being designed, 2) there are many desired characteristics of the system, such as, security, scalability, availability, accessibility, access speed, and high throughput. From the experience, we already know that implementing too many of those non-functional requirements is not recommended.  As a project manager and architect, how you would balance between these non-functional requirements for the system?
