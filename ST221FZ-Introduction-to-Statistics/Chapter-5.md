## 5.1 Continuous random variables~连续随机变量~



Suppose we are interested in **the probability that a given continuous random variable will take on a value on the interval==区间== from a to b**==给定的连续随机变量在 a 到 b 区间中的概率==, where a and b are <u>constants</u>==常量== with a ≤ b. 

Suppose, furthermore, that we divide the interval from a to b into m <u>equal subintervals</u>==等长子区间== of width ∆x containing, respectively, the points x1, x2, · · · , xm, and that the probability that the random variable will take on a value in the subinterval containing xi is given by f(xi)∆xi. Then the probability that the random variable with which we are concerned will take on a value in the interval from a to b is
given by
