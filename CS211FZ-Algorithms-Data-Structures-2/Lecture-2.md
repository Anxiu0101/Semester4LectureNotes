## Importance of BST(Binary Search Tree)

- Most of the primitive operations on search trees run in $O(h)$ time on a tree of height $h$
- The average height of a node in a binary search tree on $N$ node is $O(\lg{N})$  
- Given $N$ elements to be inserted in a binary search tree, the height of the tree depends on the order of the elements inserted•E.g., given the set of nodes with their key values from 1 – 7, •if the insertion order is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, the depth of the tree will be 6  
•If the insertion order is { 4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 7}, the depth of the tree will be 2  
•Deletion of nodes may result in an unbalanced tree
